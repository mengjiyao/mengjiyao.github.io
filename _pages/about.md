Hello! My name is Mengji Yao, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2023. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree (MSc) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University.

I am actively seeking a PhD position in the fields of Machine Learning, Robotics, and Control Systems. I am particularly interested in research related to reinforcement learning in robotics and theoretical foundation and application of deep learning.
